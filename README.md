# Storybook TypeScript React Component Library

Simple to use React Component Library with Storybook using TypeScript 3.0 and Storybook 4.0. Bootstrapped using Create-React-App 2.1.

Compiles all code to a build folder for exporting. Creates a static version of Storybook site for hosting. Makes assumptions on TypeScript, TSLint, Webpack, and storybook Addon configurations.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the storybook site at http://localhost:53217/

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Compiles source files into build directory with type annotations upon succesful lint.

Builds a static site of storybook to be hosted to your liking.

### `npm run eject`

*From Create-React-App 2.0*

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
